## Known Bugs

B18 - THIS ISN'T FIXED YET. Clicking on a pin brings up the hover state. When swiping to the next contintent, hover state should automatically disappear. Instead the hover state remains until user selects new pin. See image of South America with hover state Waltham & DC.

B19 - THIS ISN'T FIXED YET. Tapping on pin shows hover state in mobile. Double tapping on pin should close the hover state.


## Challenge

TODO: B18 + B19 are unsolvable problems limited mobile devices by capability because of the nature of touch screen devices don't support hover events at all. These jQuery only supports mobile gestures requiring single-tap event open and common double-tap events to close. I don't have an fix for these problems. Unless you can provide current example of mobile website using these hover tooltips as an reference. I can't resolve these bugs.
